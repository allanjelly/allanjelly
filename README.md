## Hi there 👋

I work as a freelance expert/project manager/team manager on ERP projects.
I have 15+ years of experience managing teams in complex real-world environments:
   - SAP (ABAP)
   - Java
   - .Net
   - C++
   - Python, GOlang
Sometimes all at the same time.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities.
